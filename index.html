            I'd like to keep this section as brief as possible so that more time may be spent enjoying the content below. My name is Sebestyén Sandor and I have two passions in this life. The first is making movies and the second is playing music. I'm absolutely obsessed with both and could do either forever and never get bored.

            <h4>Everything's Shit</h4>
            <p class="project_description"><b>Description:</b> This was my senior year capstone project at the University of Pittsburgh. I originally had another idea which was a mockumentary based around an amateur frisbee golf athlete, but the actor who I based the character on couldn't commit the time to the project so I had to quickly think of something that only involved my time (everyone I knew was a senior and busy trying to get their degree) - something quite challenging in a medium that usually requires teamwork. I had to come up with creative ways to make something that looks good and was engaging with the limitations that come with making a short film alone for example, there was no way I could move the camera and be infront of it at the same time. I enjoyed making this project and am proud of it. The most important thing I learned from this project is to get more angles than you think you need because I find the Chapter 2 of this short quite repetitive.</p>

            <h4>Shane's Final Assignment</h4>
            <p class="project_description"><b>Description:</b> This is the project where I learned to produce videos with the mind of an editor. If I want a certain sequence of frames, those are the shots I need to capture with the camera. I picture the final scene in my head and work backwards from there. Editing became my favorite part of the film making process. I remember editing the final sequence of this short and having to stop because I was overwhelmed with joy at the realization that I have the capacity to express myself through film. I got exactly what was in my head, and had been in my head for months, out. It felt incredibly freeing. I got over my ex in that moment.</p>

        <div id="pitt_student_survey_page" class="project_page">
            <h4>Pitt Student Survey</h4>
            <p class="project_description"><b>Description:</b> This was just a fun group project we did in class. I took a mockumentary class my second semester at Pitt after I had barely passed my neuro class first semester. I quickly realized I'd be miserable if I did 4 years of intense science so I tried something else. I've always enjoyed watching the mockumentaries the most as I feel my thoughts are a little too meta and the mockumentary is a format where meta humor fits perfectly. The funniest jokes are the slight nods to and looks a character gives the audience. Spending time in the mockumentary class exposed me to film ideas I became really interested in. Just to give a couple of brief examples, the director can show us anything they wish and present it as the truth, it's ultimately up to us whether we believe what we're being spoonfed. What is a director deliberately omitting? What's right next to the frame that they're not showing us? What strings is the director pulling to give us a good show?</p>

            <h4>Peter Bark</h4>
            <p class="project_description"><b>Description:</b> This was a group project we did in class. If I remember correctly, each member of the group had a different role in production, but each group member had to edit their own rendition of the footage. I am a strong believer that music decides that atmosphere of the scene, something that holds true for the end of this short. There isn't a sequence I've thought of where the soundtrack isn't playing in my head in the background. I still really like this song and I have another sequence I want to see on a screen and instead of in my head that has this song playing through it, it'll be part of a bigger passion project I'm working on.</p>

        <div id="one_pager_page" class="project_page">
            <h4>Warhol One Pager</h4>
            <p class="project_description"><b>Description:</b> Every member of the first-ever Warhol x LOOK Creaive Guild internship received the same one page script and we all pulled a random genre out of a hat. This was my attempt at the comedic genre. I had a great time making this with the help of my younger brother. I was at home in Budapest when I was filming this so I had limited access to equipment. During the production for this project, I learned there's a way to solve every potential problem that may arise. There's always a way to get the shot, it may take some time and thinking, but there's always a way.</p>

        <div id="sizzle_page" class="project_page">
            <h4>Warhol Sizzle</h4>
            <p class="project_description"><b>Description:</b> This sizzle project for the Warhol x LOOK Creaive Guild internship is just supposed to be a quick exciting video promoting the intership and quickly showing the experiences we had. I like it for what it is, but I would be more proud of it if I wouldn't have had to split my time between school and the editing. I dream of one day spending my professional time editing and making videos, and just have that one focus.</p>

        <div id="personal_dev_page" class="project_page">
            <h4>Warhol Personal Development Project</h4>
            <p class="project_description"><b>Description:</b> This project was my summary of the Warhol x LOOK Creaive Guild internship. This is another situation where I wish I would've had more time to edit and make it really the way I want. Other projects were coming due towards the end of the semester. During this project I learned a lot about how to tie different snippets of a lot of footage into a cohesive piece. You have to pay attention to every word and have what you're showing be logical when compared to what you're hearing. I really enjoyed the internship and feel it was filled with valuable experiences I'll take with me to future film production opportunities.</p>
